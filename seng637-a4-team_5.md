# Introduction

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

Test cases were written to assess unique functionalities of the SUT (Shop Smart Canada Website). Some of the core functionalities examined were:
- User Profile Functionality
    - Log In
    - Edit Account Details
    - Sign Out
- Shopping Functionality
    - Adding products to cart
    - Editing cart
    - Proceding to checkout
- Product Search Functionality

For each of these functionalities, various tests were designed to ensure the GUI responded to events appropriately. 

In designing each test case, the team performed each of the functionalities on the SUT to gain an understanding of expected behaviour. Once this exploration was complete, functionalities were split into numerous tests which allowed for better error tracking and readability of test cases (For example, the shopping functionality, which consists of adding a product to a cart, updating the quantity of items in the cart, then proceding to checkout was split into 3 tests).

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

Assertions were used in each test case to ensure the expected result occured for each test. Various types of assertions were used. For example, when updating the quantity of items in the cart, assert text was used to ensure the change had been reflected in the checkout price. A different example would be for when a user signs in, assert title was used to ensure the user was directed to the appropriate next page.

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

Each functionality was tested with various test data to ensure a certain degree of robustness when possible. Examples of this include creating tests to asses the result of both valid login credentials and invalid credentials. Another example for the search function was to test a valid product which returns many results as well as incoherent text which should be expected to return 0 results.

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Part 1: 
.........

Part 2:
Each member was responsible for designing GUI test cases for 1 one the core website functionalities (minimum 2 test cases per functionality). After the test cases were for each functionality were designed. Each member implemented the test cases designed by another member in Selenium. This allowed for team members to double check the developed test cases with a second pair of eyes. 

All members contributed equally to the writing of the lab report. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
One of the challenges encountered during the GUI testing was due to the asynchronous nature of websites, where an assertion would fail before the new content of the website could load. This challenge was overcome by using the 'wait' functionality to ensure proper order of operations for each test.

# Comments/feedback on the assignment itself
The GUI testing portion of this lab provided a great opportunity to write tests for common user interfaces, and learn how tools like Selenium may be used to automate tests for a large, professional website with many functionalities.
